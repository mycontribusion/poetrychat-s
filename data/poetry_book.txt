From Behind a
Young Man’s Chest

by Ahmad Musa


-- introduction --


(I start) in the name of Allah, and peace and blessings be upon
the prophet of Allah. After that:
All praise is due to Allah! All praise is due to Allah! All praise is
due to Allah! For His mercy on me, for giving me the ability as
well as the chance to complete this book. Peace and blessings
of Allah be upon His messenger, Prophet Muhammad.

TITLE: Why I Write


The end shouldn't be these words
Clinging to the sheet or screen.
The goal shouldn't be for the heart
To journey with the flow and rhyme.
The goal should be the clear crystal
That forms around those words -
A lens through which minds could see
Things they were unable to see.
Like what lies behind the veil of death:
The world, Paradise and the fire of Hell.

----


To my parents I will say as Allah asked us to say in regards to
our parents “...My Lord, have mercy upon them as they
brought me up [when I was] small.” (Qur’an 17:24)

How it started: one day as I was going through my poems that
were scattered across several platforms an idea was sown in
my chest. I watered it with my sweat, fed it my time and my
brain. Here I am, happy to present to you the fruit.

I in summary: I was introduced to the real poetry world by a
friend Ayo Ibrahim Badmus. He along with another brother of
mine Abdullahi Yusuf held my hands until I grew up my own
legs and ran away.

It in brief: More than a hundred partly arranged poems, titled
and untitled ones.

They in summary: several events and scenarios inspired the
writing of these poems. From macron showing his beast side,
the murder of Haneefa in Kano, wanting to write inside
Adaidaita, at Gadar K/Ruwa, remembering some Qur’anic
verses and Hadith etc. Making the categories to be many and
diverse including religion, parents, marriage, school, life etc.
Although significant numbers of the poems were written in
reply to Allpoetry.com contest prompts.I am happy you are able to make it to this point. I wish you a
happy journey through the book. Thank you.

TITLE: Verses From Qur'an


He is Allah
The One
The Master whose control is complete.
The All-Knowing
Who is perfect in His knowledge.
No leaf falls but He knows it
And no grain is there within the darkness of the earth
Or anything moist or dry but that it is written in a clear record.
There is no deity except Him,
The Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.
Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on
the earth.
He knows what is before and after his creations
While they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for
what He wills.
His footstool extends over the heavens and the earth,
And their preservation tires Him not
Indeed He is the Most High, the Most Great.


----
TITLE: Naivety


From the sea
Of knowledge,
How sure is man
That he has grasped
Up to a drop?
How naive is he
To conflict the word
Of his lord -
Who created him
And the things around?


----
TITLE: Acknowledgement


We Acknowledge Your Blessings
We want new lives
But can only sow dead seeds.
In our helplessness
You give us children and plants.
On dry land
Where we can't reach to the clouds.
In our hopelessness
You cause sweet rain to fall.
We fight cold weather
And need woods as guards.
On the eve of sure defeat
You cause trees to grow.
The nice body we wear
And the nice home we met.
We thank You O Allah
For Your infinite blessings on us.


----
TITLE: A Wish


During times like this
When trials get hard.
I have a wish: if only,
The prophet is here.
The trials might come
But our faith will be strong.
That even if galaxies were to fall
Fear will be alone.


----
TITLE: The Bearer of Light

Men could not see-
Their eyelids apart or closed.
The world was yearning
For someone with even a piece of light,
So they could see
The world, and their purpose of life.
Then came the prophet
With light - that if shone on the sun,
The sun will like a cloud
Defeatedly drop its shadow on the land.
Yet many turned away
And chose to close their eyes.
They continued to wander
And succeeded in wasting their time.


----
TITLE: The Gift, Ahmad


In truth,
it was a gift.
Like a map,
a guide in life.


-----
TITLE: The Ultimate Trust

All agreed
That the patient won't make it
The patient disagreed
Because of a statement
For he had been told
He will witness a conquest
And he had been told by
Prophet Muhammad


----
TITLE: Role Model


Who should I be today?
If only I could be like Muhammad
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
But that'd mean my eyes
Won't close,
Until charity has devoured my wealth.
So that before tomorrow comes,
Luxury and convenience
Would have no stain left on me.
I really wish to be like the Prophet
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
To stand, when heads are glued to pillows
Bow and fall on my face.
And ponder upon life at death,
Ponder upon life in grave,
Ponder upon judgment day.
And have these thoughts pierce
My sac of tears,
To form a spring that wets my beard.
I should be like Ahmad
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
And stand behind the truth
Even if that means I would be alone.
And fight behind the truth
Even if my enemy would be the world.


----
TITLE: The Footprint


If I had a shoe he wore
It would've been
What I treasure most -
Even 14 hundred cycles of year
Could not erase
The footprints he left.
Windstorms, earthquakes
and others have tried,
Showing how great he was.
He is the most dearest to me
For he taught
The purpose of life -
That we should strive
To earn the gifts on judgment day,
Not the lent items on earth.
And only he
Was shown Jannah and the way to it
Hence
I shall only tread on these footprints
Of his


----
TITLE: Red Line

I can feel my sanity gushing out of me.
I can feel that madness is winning
And about to take the control of me.
I feel pain in my chest
Their target was indeed me.
Harm has reached my prophet
The man I live to protect.
The day we shall meet
Shall mark the end of their stay.
And those who will come for my head
Should know, I ceased living since on this day


----
TITLE: Parents


As the plant germinates,
it saw that it has to penetrate
In order to satiate
It's normal metabolic rate
So as to escape
A decay-fate.
It looked back, surprised.
How it made it to this day alive,
And what it took for it to survive,
Though no effort from its part,
Not even an attempt from the start.
Its answer was: my mom and dad.


----
TITLE: The Garment, Ahmad


My parents, seeing
Many lost
And confused,
Gave me a garment.
That if I should wear
And fit in nicely.
That would mean
I have succeeded in life.


----
TITLE: Mom


Here I read my present to thee
To show what thy sweat has bore.
A prove that thy thole was not in vain.
Regarding those travails I cannot repay.
I searched but couldn't find a thing worth thy tear.
Then, I realized that this world is poor, and
Only Paradise possesses things thee deserve.
May the angels chant Aameen
As I pray to Allaah:
"O the possessor of great bounty,
Grant her Jannatul Firdaus.”


----
TITLE: Respect


A radiance that
Weighs on souls.
And causes them
To give a bow.
Though their bodies
Could be held from so.


----
TITLE: Salaat


He is a stranger
And knows no one but you.
His lifespan is brief
Your small care will do.
Fend off his loneliness
And grateful he'll be to you.
When you turn a stranger
And loneliness hugs you in grave.
You will see him again
Then shall you know who he is.
He will remember your treatment
And treat you the same as well


----
TITLE: The Row


Come to success!
Come to success!
The call has been made.
It's time to join the row
And stretch the line of hearts.
That fall and rise together
In hope of achieving success.


----
TITLE: True Love

Love only grows
On the land of heart,
Where it can stretch
Its scent, freely and wide.
To reach every corner,
That knows of blood.
It has a fragrance
That can soak all walls,
Which allows it to leak
Into the outside world.
Hence a scent
Only felt from few points
Without a doubt
Is not from true love.


----
TITLE: Rope is Life

In Their Physical State
The frog hovers over an abyss -
A transformed form of death.
Eyes-widened it held onto life
That condensed into a rope.


----
TITLE: To Each Its Day


A tree can
With its all, shake
To unbury you
From a pile of sand.
Which can turn your grave
Should your gold-mountain
Be asked
To aid.


----
TITLE: Who Knows


Isn't it because my skin is dark
That I say color shouldn't differentiate us?
Isn't it because my store is void
That I question what the rich men do?
Isn't it because my head is uncrowned
That I see those good decisions easy to make
Have I not been the way I am
Would I have thought the same?


----
TITLE: The Duo


Many words
Being shared by the duo.
That maybe
Could’ve lighten the world.
What a pity
They will never appear.
As she won't remember
When she will be able to write.


[Note: Image prompt of a kid staring at her pet]


----
TITLE: Covid19


Diseases do move round,
With no glue they slide and pass.
Destiny makes them stick,
To those who fall sick.


----
TITLE: Ranking Competition


Humans seek for power-
That could uproot
All mountains.
Humans seek for wealth-
That’d fill the openings
With diamonds.
Humans seek for knowledge-
That could be used
In both actions.
Life would still have been peaceful
If not for their crave
For top ranking.
Turning them into creatures so cruel-
That find fun in squeezing souls
Out of their bodies.
But aren’t all these distractions,
From their main purpose?


----
TITLE: The Dreadful Thing Below


What's below luxurious life
So dreadful,
That its thought could char
Even the wet heart.
And makes it willing to elevate its status
Through burying its fellows?


----
TITLE: The Protrusion


A Politician Comes for Campaign
The hillish protrusion,
Resembling a four year old pregnancy,
That has devoured our community
Into living skeletons
Will soon deliver,
Its foul smelling regurgitate.

----
TITLE: Where Zoo Is Better


Our speech is not understood
By those who rule.
Like creatures in a zoo
But here, predators can roam.
We keep yelling for help
Yet raised grounds continue to grow
Some killed by thirst, hunger and some
By humanoid beasts.
Are we still humans to them
Or is that also taking ourselves too highly?
Or is it our screams that aren’t loud
Enough, to gain their attention.


----
TITLE: The Whites


Like Lions, they bite
To first injure their prey,
And then wait sideways
While putting front of saints.
With wounds,
The preys cannot go far away.
To free themselves
From those bloodthirsty fangs.


----
TITLE: The Tyrant Summer Ends


Didn’t you once said you came to stay?
Why does it seem you are on your way?
How long has it been since you made that claim?
How nice does it feel being dragged away?
I pray men learn from your mistake.


----
TITLE: Her Skull Is Without A Brain


To rush food into the mouth
But refuse to swallow.
To use a helmet on the head
But leave the body naked.
To spend billions over a headache
But not a penny on malignancies.
To what end? And
Would it have been different than
If she had no head?


----
TITLE: The House


How many starved
And became bones
To make the wall this hard.
How many aged
And turned drooped
To keep the roof this high.
How many died
And were buried
For the floor to be this wide.
What is it or who is it
How should one ask
Of the thing that lives here?


----
TITLE: Haiku III


Empty storerooms
Hugged by a blood-reeking land
Northern Nigeria


----
TITLE: The Soldiers


They are our brothers and sisters,
Who gave up their freedom
So that ours can grow.
They are our fathers and mothers,
Who left their homes
So that families can live.
They are our friends, our fellow humans,
Who sacrificed their souls
To wall and limit the blasts
Which could have consumed us all.
They witness the souls of their comrades
Dimming, until only a corpse is left.
They see the bodies of their companions
Shattering, until no bone to entomb.
Yet except for the bright uniform hanging
Behind them, their melting front
Remains hidden from us.


----
TITLE: How Certain?


Like a man,
Whose gaze spreads on the sky
Firmly believing, its brightness will change.
So is a Muslim
when he watches the world,
He firmly believes, judgment day will come.


----
TITLE: Sign of Strength


Cloth has become heavy
And a thing only for the strong.
Weaklings have turned to minis
Slips and things same as none.


----
TITLE: It Rains Everyday


It's summer in the north,
Yet its land is still muddy
From the tears of grief.
Raining season had left for long,
Yet its sky is filled
With deafening sound.
Fear, despair and grief,
Have petrified its people
Into walking clouds.
O Allah, we admit our sins,
Grace us with peace
Indeed You are the Oft-Forgiving.


----
TITLE: Just Like


Happiness will continue to retreat,
The more immoralities get pulled from behind the walls.
Just like
A garden's look will continue to diminish,
The more ugly roots get pulled out from within the soil.


----
TITLE: Immorality


A flood from the west
How many will survive?


----
TITLE: A Savage Specie 


The green North
Is drowning in blood.
Its land is disappearing
And being replaced by graves.
Its calm air
Has been exiled,
Leaving fear
For its people to breath.
Rivers of migrants
Flow non-stop,
Below the fierce sun
And heavy night.
Some wild humans -
A savage specie -
Have made homelessness better
Than staying at home.


----
TITLE: Alternative To Money


With no notes
To step on and fly
The pages are there
To take you anywhere


[Notes: money]


----
TITLE: The Voice


This, is the voice of poetry
For I've heard him speak many times.
Though I can't describe it in words
But I, can imitate him
As a poet.


----
TITLE: Laziness


I'm an eagle trapped within walls
Of laziness, viewing the outside world.
As nothing could hold my gaze,
I am yet to flap my wings.


----
TITLE: Music


When met by the beats from music,
I feel like hammers pounding on my body.
And I’m forced to act on instinct,
To break free from the pain I suffer.
In many, music stimulates a center,
The one in brain responsible for pleasure.
But for me I don't know if I am a mutant
For only pain centers seem to be responding


----
TITLE: Ko'ed


Suddenly, I felt a head dropped on my shoulder
As if he has been KO'ed.
But to his right and to his left
No one was in a fighting stance.
So I was inclined,
To him being knocked out
By sleep.


----
TITLE: The Ovulation Scene


Beaming wildly she stood
Before her defeated pears.
She was ovulated afterwards.


[Note: From among the scenes before birth.]


----
TITLE: Childhood Memory


A beardless chin
Reached the wooden door.
With his half its height,
He raced
Against lean exclamations
Exiting the TV-litted room.
Unaware of being watched
From the future;
Outside the mind;
By a bearded face;
Admiring his unwavering will.


----
TITLE: To Friends


For how long do you
Want to remain as friends?
Or you are so eager
For death to bring you aid?
And therefore you help
Each other in committing sin
So your tie would be
Consumed by hell.


----
TITLE: My Goat


Why would I need someone else
To think highly of me?
When she
Has done exactly that.
To her I'm the shade
That fights the sunrays away.
I'm the roof that won't let
The cloud lay its fingers on her.
To her I'm the Greatest Of All Time
And to me she too is my goat.


----
TITLE: Self-Overestimation


I thought we were close.
I really thought we were friends.
I thought I was a close friend,
Close enough to first hear it from you
Of the ant
That gave you a bite;
And the fragrance
Of the new perfume you bought;
Most importantly the date
You plan to wed your love.
I thought I too will come to your mind
Whenever you have a news to share.
Or an information,
That I'd be among those you'd remember
To tell.
But now i doubt everything.
I seem to have placed myself
Far above where I belong.


----
TITLE: The Withered Goal


Till when?
Till when will the dying goal -
The goal to attain Jannah - gain
From the rain of sweat,
That pours
On the other goals in our heart?
And have its yellows too
Turned into greens,
With just some efforts
On which it too could feed.


----
TITLE: Human's Forgetfulness


Indeed man is forgetful
When has he left the womb
That he has forgotten,
The death sentence he received
And here he is, playful.


----
TITLE: Quran


At the angle of my bed
Touching the wall
Lies my Qur'an -
A filter
Which repels any impurity
That has stained a soul.


----
TITLE: Asking for Jannah


I have asked for Jannah, far more
Than my eyelids have parted
Before the arrival of dawn.
I have asked for Jannah, far more
Than my ears have accompanied
Athan in its rise.
I have asked for Jannah, far more
Than fasting has spoon-fed
My sense buds with bitterness.
Clearly, my effort to get Jannah
Has been left
To the joint between my jaws.


----
TITLE: Why is he Here?


As the sight strikes
The vastness of the world,
The eyes look confused.
Helplessness falls in
When it can't see
Through those with masks.
The lost then increases
As ears get struck by calls.
Forcing the mind to invite bedlam
As an associate.
What should he do -
Being brought by Birth,
Before being called back -
To fulfill why he was here?
Should he listen
To words by Islam
He’d find them clear
And also true.
If he chooses him as guide,
He’d feel at ease, ready
To return anytime.


----
TITLE: Being Ungrateful


My lungs do not gasp
Before they’re given air to breath.
My throat does not get dry
Before it's given water to drink.
My belly does not grumble
Before it's given food to eat.
Nothing is needed to live, except that
It’s placed within my reach.
Yet in search for more
I don't blink before I sin.
Forgive me O Allah
For I’m indeed weak.


----
TITLE: Life Lies Between Two Cries


The journey is between two cries.
Bodies leap into the air,
Lips part to reveal a smile
And the race is started with a joyful cry
Hands are freed and teeth relax.
Then bodies fall and roll on the ground
Lips retreat to welcome tears
An anguish cry sounds to mark the end
Fists form and teeth are clenched
A journey between two cries.


----
TITLE: One Day

The sun will rise one day
And stare at the chair, building,
Car and land.
Then call the moon before it fades.
On that night it too
Will search the room, bed
And will also think the same.
When neither sees the footprint appear nor
Hear the snoring sound.


----
TITLE: Pure Manifestations


The proud flying arrow
Won’t know:
That its birth, aims, hardworks
And fall;
Were manifestations of a thought
Of an archer.


----
TITLE: The Sinning Frog


The limping frog has jumped again.
Will the mirage turn into a pond,
To quench its burning thirst?
Or will the hope it carries
Be its only gain,
And will hit a solid ground?


----
TITLE: Blindness


A disbeliever
Has over his eyelid another lid
Made of death,
Beyond which he sees nothing
But an endless darkness -
Like the one in front of a closed eye.
Hence when warned of that
Which stands right before his nose
That could burn him alive
On taking another step.
He tilts his head back
And his chest swells with pride
Feeling proud of his state
Of being blind
Of 'is inability to see the surroundin'
Behind death.
Should he heed the call
And be cured.
He too would see
The purpose of life:
To climb back home -
The garden of eternity.


----
TITLE: Look Down


When you are at your lowest point
Be thankful to Allah
As that is the peak of Mount Everest
To many souls.
So console yourself with this mountain
You have.
And wish for them best
The things you miss.


-----
TITLE: Incomplete Narrations


Molds continue to form from stories
(Of men)- that were written and told.
Their abilities are exploited by men
To achieve their goals.
Success and Failure, the two bags-
Where the casts are stored.
Many allotting events have passed, only
Those living have come.
Often sources do blame Death,
That it severs their link.
Admitting their narrations of the deceaseds
Were never complete:
Wisdom from experiences in that life
Formed what were missed-
Information to draw conclusion on,
Who are successful in life.


----
TITLE: Science


The most influential
Infant in the world.
That leads its parents
While continuing
To suckle their sweat.


----
TITLE: The Weak Senses


Am I alone
In this quiet place
Or is it my ears too
Deceiving me?
My lost to a dog
In the smelling competition
Had blown away
My confidence.
I raised my hand
To regain my pride
Unaware a cruel
Mosquito has landed on it.
How true
Are what they say to me?
And how much are they
Hiding from me?


----
TITLE: Weak lens


I see the sky
Not through some gaps,
Because my eyes
Cannot see some things.


----
TITLE: Not Asked


How can man be free,
When he is not of needs?
He needs air to breath
And water to drink.
He needs food to eat,
In his prescribed time to live.
His choice was not sought,
When he was made a man.
He could've been an animal,
What makes him feel conceit?
A bastard or a child,
A black man or a white,
From rich kins or from poor,
On rich land or on poor,
in peace time or in war,
He picked none yet he wore.
He'd recall from where he came,
Was he asked, 'where should we...?'
Or asked 'when should we?'
Same overbearing will be replayed,
When it's time for him to leave.


----
TITLE: Better is not Better


If man’s eyes could see better,
His mouth would’ve been less followed.
Until it becomes desolate,
And he is devoured by hunger.
And if his ears could hear better,
Silence would’ve drove sleep away forever.
Till his sanity is crushed into pieces
By the unending noise around him.
Therefore we thank You O Allah, The All-knowing,
For perfecting our creation.


----
TITLE: View All at Once


When man
The commensal,
Will view
The whole of space
At once.
Then, he'll realize
How tiny
His host - Earth is.
When he searches,
And the Earth is no where
To be seen.


----
TITLE: The Arrogant Debtor


Man lends
Gases from atmosphere;
Water from hydrosphere;
Energies from sun;
Fruits from trees;
Crops from plants;
Wealth from earth.
Yet he tries to convince himself,
Claiming he owns
What he has.
However when the day comes,
To return things back.
Then, he can’t deny,
That he owns nothing
Except his deeds.


----
TITLE: All Praise is due to Allah


Had food been free;
Water cheap;
And air expensive;
Few would've lived.
Praise due to Allah,
Who makes
Harder to monopolize,
Things needed more.


----
TITLE: Haiku II


A malnourished crowd.
An obese underground bridge
Feet covered in dust.


----
TITLE: A Snake


On that day
I was beside the driver
When on the road,
I witnessed the birth
Of a creature.
It was rushing forward, but
By sliding in and out
From in between
The trucks with its head,
And its body too
Followed the pattern.
Indeed I saw it slithering
Like a snake.
But I believe unlike me,
What the driver saw:
Was different cars
Sliding in and out,
Overtaking the serial trucks.
Perhaps it was my imagination.


----
TITLE: Haiku I


An unsteady pen
On a sunny city drive
A galloping car


----
TITLE: The Crazy Driver


I was sitting beside the driver
Pressing my phone,
Only to raise my head and see
A truck facing our car.
Was the driver crazy, not stopping
Or moving to the side?
I thought when I saw the driver
Showing no sign of dodging the truck.
Thoughts began to gush out of my mind,
When I realized that the truck
Was being pulled away.
I even read the name Iveco
Written on the spoilt truck.


----
TITLE: Who/What


Why's a man who?
Why's a beast what?
What does he has?
What does it lack?
Men brag of brain
Beasts also think
Why is he man?
Why is it beast?
He has two scales;
It has just one.
Mood and morals
It lives on mood.


----
TITLE: macron, the beast!


no wonder
its mouth could make that sound.
it has lost its mind a long time ago.
who'd know that
frenchmen were deceived all this while.
perhaps its rag that look like cloth.
should they recall
the incident back then.
could that have been done by a human being?


----
TITLE: macron!


you should have kept that secret safe -
of the smelly ignorance, rotting
inside that rag.
even if you would've needed to close that stoolish
mouth of yours, by slapping your face everytime.
and people would've been able to name you – madman.
at least your stupidity would’ve been within what they can
name.


----
TITLE: Another Tragedy


Is this where the story shall end?
Of the two people, a child and a beast.
Will there be no page next
But the back cover again?
So that this too remains a tragedy.
Is killing, now an act so noble
That murderers lead in our stories?
Colouring the scenes
Where souls are ripped out of bodies
And graves flooding the lands.
Will a page be added to this story
So it doesn't end with Haneefa's death?
To leave behind at least a lesson
That will calm our country, Nigeria.


----
TITLE: The judgment day


The day
Man shall stand
Before Allah.
Stripped of titles
And clothes.
From womb or from tomb,
Humans are weak.


----
TITLE: What Do Us Muslims Fear?


The day that will decide
For all the days one has lived,
Either to say no, or yes
Should they be asked:
If they had ever,
Held pleasure in them.


----
TITLE: He Never Gave up


He rekindled the lamp,
For us to see
The reality of life
And what the darkness
Behind death has screened.
He wanted us
To know our purpose of life.
Yet at Daa’if
People threw him stones, until
Blood streaked down his feet.
The people of Makkah
Drew their swords that left him wounded
With two links of his helmet firmly in his cheek.
The Jews of Madina fed him poison
Which killed a companion of his,
While he himself continued to feel its effect
Until his death.
Yet he didn’t give up
On them,
And continued to illuminate the world.
Who has benefited us more than him?
Or sacrificed for us more than him?
Therefore I call upon you
Whose eyes are closed,
I swear I can see
You're on the edge of a pit of hell.
I call upon you
To please part those lids,
So we can be neighbors
In Paradise
And fulfill the wish
Of Rasulullah.
(Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)


----
TITLE: Khadija: Mother of the Believers


She was the Prophet's wife
Before his prophethood
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
And she was his only wife
With whom he had children.
Before the angel's visits,
When he'd retreat to Mount Hira cave
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
His provisions she prepared well
She was such a caring wife.
On the day he was squeezed,
For being unable to read
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
She was the first he rushed to
She was such a supportive wife.
The first Muslimah was her
And his migration was after her death,
The Prophet always missed her
And her friends he continued treat well.
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.

TITLE: My Little Sister


I knew of a time when mom
Did not know of you.
And a time when you
Didn’t know who you are.
And I know that one day,
You will be pulled
Into a flipped page of time.
Indeed there are
So many goals in this world,
Their number could rival that of grains.
But not all the goals in this world,
Are the reasons you're on earth.
Your purpose in life
Is to strive and worship Allah-
Who created death and life to test us
As to who will be best in deeds.
This way by His grace
We shall rejoice again,
At the Garden of Firdaus
Far more, than we did on earth.
Therefore be patient
Not to follow those astray,
Who’ll effortlessly fall into the pit of hell.


----
TITLE: Hijab Is a Common Noun


Hijab wasn’t prescribed by men
But by Allah, the Wise.
For He knows you more than you do
For He is the All-Knowing.
It is a common noun, Hijab
Not a proper noun as thought.
It is any wall that walls off,
The thieving eye from you.


----
TITLE: Mere Memories


We are in a world owned by Allah.
And non-existence is a place to hide
When His punishment approaches
Those who transgress.
His torment is so severe
Sweet memories crumble at its sight.
And His rewards are unmatched
Worth a million year wait.
Therefore let’s abide by His laws to obtain
The better of the two eternal fates.


----
TITLE: Play Your Role


Lay down your arrogance, turn
And look through time.
Watch what was done
By Satan before Adam.
When Allah decreed
Adam's status is above his -
Rejecting his Lord, instead
Of bowing down.
Spouting some excuse
But at the end, what did he gained?
To be burn in hell
Surely was not a good gain.
Superiority of men
Likewise is not self-earned
It remains so,
As long as we're in this world
And positions in the Hereafter
Will depends on our deeds.
Islam is fair, and in it
Each gender has roles
Strive to give your best
And walk the path laid by its Laws
To seek for justice
When your right is trampled on.
And Allah will be your judge
If us humans are unjust.


----
TITLE: Very Weak


As researches dig more
And our understanding grows wide,
Many things have become clear
Including how weak, man is.
The ease with which he can perish,
Makes it a miracle that he still lives.
From the way he lifts his head,
Without feeling any of the cells he used,
And also spread his arms,
While unaware of the processes involved.
Yet he only wills in his mind,
And his chest also will swell in pride.
His lack of control over his cells, while
Each can plan against him.
Like starving themselves to death,
Or rebelling against themselves;
Allowing a malignant change in them
Or failing to play their role.
The earth below him could quake
The buildings around could fall
The flowing rivers could also erupt.
All these may happen and may not.
But what will his emotions be
When he is visited by Malakul Maut?


----
TITLE: Medical Students


Before me is a crowd
Donned in white,
Struggling and sweating
To get half.
Who at some points in their lives
Always had their goals high.
But now have forgotten when last
They got all, right.
And their best have become
Those, who get a bigger half.


----
TITLE: O' Medical Student


Could you
Have saved that person,
If you were alone?
Would your knowledge
Have worth some pennies,
To buy him some time? Or
Would your eyes and ears
Have wasted their transmitters
In contacting the fat in your skull?
O you medical student
Not much time is left
Before you turn a saver or a killer
When souls will present
With death rushing into their bronchioles
Their eyes widened, horrified
As they drown in the sea of illness.


----
TITLE: Catch It


A trap may say
I'd have caught it".
But what weight
Would that have
On a stomach
That is grumbling.


----
TITLE: Feeling Cheated


I had fear
Move far away from me.
So I couldn't understand why,
The stuff refused to come near.
I sent all the signals
From throwing pleading gazes,
To blankly staring at the drip.
But it still betrayed my trust,
And I was left to stand alone.
With no stuff to unsheathe
Or fear to take for shelter.


----
TITLE: Too Stuffy


The stuffs weighed heavily on me,
I had to struggle
To keep my upper eyelids up.
I lost the focus
To listen to her talk, and
All my effort was to stay awake.
My back screamed
Tired of floating on air,
Only hoping to land and have some rest.
I was feeling like
Only her lips were moving, and
Even the watches seemed to have stopped.


[Note: Stuff is a slang which means “the knowledge one has gathered.”]


----
TITLE: My Teachers


Where I stood there was no light
The rule was steep - hard to walk on
They pulled it down from their bright side
So I could reach even if I lie down


----
TITLE: It's From Complex To Simple


Many now claim
It was from simple to complex.
That all things evolved
And were not created.
They claim it was by trial and error
Yet fail to bring the things
That were with mistakes.
History recorded that sun
Existed before torchlights;
It also narrated that
Birds were before aircrafts;
The whale that swims
Wasn't copied from small boats;
The versatile them too
Have been living before robots.
Isn't their claim the biggest
Miracle that'd be thought of?
An unintelligent nothing
Producing an intelligent person.
Aren’t they trying to uproot
The tree of science
Which has been feeding
On the sweat of experiments?
By jumping to say
That Judgment day isn’t coming
And making it a law
With no research or inquiry.


----
TITLE: The Show


The sound of rain echoed,
And I saw cracks
Spreading through the lifeless land.
And creatures that were thought
To have gone forever
Appeared, rising to their feet;
Their leaves, branches and flowers
Were emerging like their decay
Was just a type of hiding.
And the display of the fading greenland
Was a facade, not the end of life.


----
TITLE: The Way To Heaven


Year has reincarnated
Over and over again,
Through hundreds of cycles
After the ruined steps were raised.
When ascension became possible
To levels above the clouds
As the steps extended
To the starry world and beyond;
To the place where souls
Can meet the famous success
And feel the difference between it
And the illusions below.


----
TITLE: Masaajid Cannot Contain Islam


They are unjust, those
Who wish to squeeze Islam.
Islam is huge that it needs
All places where Muslims are.
And by trying to force it
Into that tiny space
Only mean, they want it dead.


----
TITLE: If And Only If


With every second new memories are born.
While some remain to join our memories,
Others grow far away
As if they never were from us.
Some we would be glad, if they should become part of our skin
For a chance to peel them off
And grind them into nothingness.
Some we would have stuck them to ourselves
Even if they should assume the form of thorn
So they may forever remain with us.
But no record, will ever be lost
Before the eyeglobe called earth.
And it shall relate on judgement day
All it has seen and felt.
Would we then be afraid, to listen
Or filled with anticipation?
As it recounts the tales,
Hoping it doesn't miss a scene.


----
TITLE: Immorality


His opponent fell,
Yet no booing could be heard.
Instead,
It was loud cheers that filled the air
That almost burst the viewers’ ears.


----
TITLE: Illusion


A root
That realizes,
That it too
Should advance
Toward the sun,
Has indeed found the way
To its destruction.


----
TITLE: No Fighting


Since I’d rot
Should I sit under the roof
For long.
And you would dry up
Should you roam about
Under the sun.
Since my spine
Is strong and can bear
The pound of rain.
And your skin is soft
capable of giving
Peace and warmth.
Instead to lose ourselves,
Competing in
What the other should do.
You and I can be one
Just like trees
Have done.


----
TITLE: Self-deception


I see a struggling tree
Pouting, "I'm me! I'm me!"
I'm aware it's being influenced,
As an anemologist who knows
Of the unseen wind.


----
TITLE: Rights To Sin


How difficult has it been,
To remain afloat
The sea of sin?
Yet more loads
Are being loaded on us
In form of rights.


----
TITLE: Prophet Jonah
(Peace be with him)


No shore could be seen,
How long can one swim?
Salt piles have been dipped
How much can one drink?
Strange sounds all over
Which fish will one serve?
Whale's tum is not home
Foods there are not cooked
Fresh water cannot reach
No air to take in
Enzymes and acids
No way can man live.
Fish's man was Godsent-
Who warned of torment
To men and cities;
'Serve God and shun sins'
For hell is torrid
No one can bear it.-
He fled from their sins
And was thrown in a sea
He prayed from the fish
And was barfed by the shore.


----
TITLE: The Solution


The future is deaf and blind
It doesn't see or hear,
Screams and tears.
Tomorrow is mute and unfeeling,
It won't utter
Any consoling word.
Later is weak and helpless,
It can't rid
The thorn in its hands.
What path is left
For the troubled
To affect what is feared?
The route walked
By Yunus - who left
A whale's tum, alive.


----
TITLE: The Last Resort Failed


When condition frowns
And creases its brows,
Humans, terrified
Resort to calling out names.
Mummy! Daddy!
The young would scream.
Friend! Help!
The old would shout.
When it turns gloomy
And no hope is in sight,
They, in their despair
Add death to their list.
Praying it appears
To relieve their pains.
Should the condition one day
Fly into a rage, like in Hell
When they'll see
Their close ones fleeing
From them.
When they'll see death
Put to death.
How then would they escape
From the Crusher,
Whose flame is fueled by rocks?


----
TITLE: What If


Would he escape
If he should tear off his shirt?
Or would he escape
If he should cut off his arm?
Perhaps he may escape
If he should rip off his head
And then hide in a grave
So he can't be haunted again.
But what if lying in wait is something
Graver, than from what he has fled?


----
TITLE: Said The Sun


Alone I've been since childhood
And have only been to places you’ve seen.
You can't imagine how long I had lived
Listen, perhaps you may pick a thing.
Neither the pain of the burning heat;
Running all day on this boring road;
And only having loneliness as company;
Has worried me ever since I’ve been.
To fulfill my purpose I can endure more
Even if in multiples I will still hang on.
A little more patience and I’ll be done
Then the breeze of success will embrace me.
How much is on you that you can't endure?
How long will it last that you can’t hang on?
I’ve lived with Adam from whom you descend
Now imagine how long and hard I’ve lived.
So remember the purpose you are on earth.
To worship Allah, and earn His reward -
The garden of pleasure, Jannatun Na’im.
And you won’t be worried ever again.


----
TITLE: The Harvest


Do not we Nigerians see Nigeria,
That it gets blessed with rainfall
In return for releasing water?
Have we too Nigerians, ever tried
Releasing virtue
And in return not get showered by peace?
Do we await anything
Apart from terror
When all that come from us
Is corruption?
Until a tomato grows from a firethorn seed
Corruption will always sprout disaster.


----
TITLE: Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara


Claiming he saw only darkness
When he studied Sahihul Bukhari
It isn’t impossible, since
He didn’t learn how to read it
With his eyelids between them
How’d the light soak his sullen field?
With his terrible chest chamber
That has charred his heart into a black coal
It shouldn’t be surprising his imagination
Contains only darkness


----
TITLE: Return Of Power


Year 2023 has enrouted,
Our power shall soon return.
For four years we've been the weak ones
Our sources of living were occupied.
Our stomachs keep wailing loudly in pain and
Our throats are dried up, about to crack.
Our lungs are taking in air that reeks of blood
Our hearts are heavy, threatening to shatter.
Here comes the chance to revive ourselves
Let's not be bribed with a bag of rice,
To exchange it again with living, at the brink of death.


----
TITLE: The False Priests


How tall can man be
To bridge
Between the heaven and earth? Or
How high can he fly
To relay
From the creations to their Lord?
For what does man then need another
To approach the All-Hearer
The All-Seer?
When the sight and hearings of humans
Have been walled-off
From even the angels.
Noah, Abraham, Moses
Jesus and Muhammad
All left after lighting that same path -
Showing that contact with saints
Or even prophets,
Isn't required to be a believer.
Therefore worship Allah
The way, He wants to be worshipped.
Through the teachings of His messenger
Who was sent to remind man of his purpose.


----
TITLE: Our Leaders


Our leaders left us exposed to the sun,
So it's their fault that our temper is hot.
And to ask them to exit those buildings,
Isn’t a demand that is overboard.
For they themselves and their positions,
Are all products of our hardwork.
All we ask are just two things
A fence with a roof on top.
A fence from the wildlife around and
A roof from the harsh weather we're in.


----
TITLE: Muhammad
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him


Muhammad
Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him
He is the epitome
Of handsomeness,
Who encompasses the whole of magnimity.
He illuminated the road to Paradise
After humanity was lost in darkness.
He described the needs of souls
Inside the body and when they leave.
If the love we have for our parents,
Would reach the height of Mount Everest.
Then the love we have for him,
Will surely exceed the sky.


----
TITLE: Year 10AH


In that year
The last message was sent, and
The last divine connection was severed
When the last prophet left.
Indeed to Allah we belong
And to him we shall all return.
It was in the third month of the year
When the news of the prophet’s death
Again struck the companions’ ears.
It carved a memory in them
And they never were the same again.
The love they showed to the prophet
Revealed the true apex of love.
And when it became clear to them
That the prophet was no longer with them
To spread the message he left
Became their new reason to live.
They spread across the land
Spreading the message of Islam
Their heart, brain and soul they gave
To nurture Islam.


----
TITLE: The Muslim Ummah Today


The way we cling onto life
Has erased the image we had -
Which casted fear in our enemies’ heart.
Now we’ve become dishes
Before their eyes,
To which they invite themselves to have.


[Notes:Inspired from a hadith in Sunan Abi Dawud 4297. Sunnah.com.]


----
TITLE: Eid Celebration


Receive a beam of greeting from me.
As we rejoice and float in glee.
Let's invite the angels to pray for our peace ,
Not the devils to feast on our good
deeds.


----
TITLE: The Marriage Life


Marriage Life
It is a life with days and nights.
The days come and leave,
But the beautiful memories
Temper the heart.
When darkness descends
And the night strikes with strength.
The heart bears the pain, and
The longing causes it to stay.
Knowing the night will soon give way
And it would be another day.
Therefore good memories
Are what keep the heart alive.
Bear this in mind
Immediately it's said that
You now are one.


----
TITLE: Dialouge At Farm


This is unfair, murmured a weed.
It's all your fault, it pointed with hate.
You won't understand, replied the crop.
You have no use, it's what you deserve.
Liar!!! liar!!! Shouted the weed.
You know I can do this, this and this.
The can you added, Said the crop,
is what differentiated you and me.
Here comes the blade, blurted the crop.
It seems our neighborhood has come to an end.


----
TITLE: The Five Slaves


Every man is given a currency
Called time,
And slaves
That may be up to five.
While he himself remains locked
Inside himself,
He remains informed
Through his slaves and time.
No time is left, means a pause
To their job
When in details they relate
Their job to The Lord.


----
TITLE: The Powerless Science


For those breathing
Dates are set,
There's nothing science can do.
For the dead
Dates have passed,
There's nothing science can do.
Judgement will hold
And nothing will science do.


--END OF POEMS--


Glory is to you, O Allah and with Your praise. Blessed is Your
name and exalted is Your Majesty. There is none worthy of
worship but You.


----
TITLE: Finally


Finally, the pearls
Have been let out of their dwelling.
They now lie on pages
For everyone to see.
And through the eyes
Be fed to their hearts:
To serve as the nourishment in need.Proof
